# Coem visualizer
This is part of the Coem project (The union of Poems and Cuentos) and in this part I'm trying to visualize all classical short stories and poems less than 8 minutes long into an embeddings map of 3092 classical short stories and 23000 poems and Also listen to the stories through Carl Sagan Voice.
The english version is coming. The links Visualization was done thanks to the help of @AgustinVallejo!

Visualize the embeddings here [Coem embeddings](https://estevefact.github.io). the links here [Coem Links](https://estevefact.github.io/authorToAuthor3D.html) and the poems here [Coem Poems](https://estevefact.github.io/poems-info.html)


# Limits
the color are only for 50 categories at maximum in the embeddings, so segment if you want to see grouping of Colors by authors

# Models used:
- Translation: NLLB
- Sentence transformer: jina-embeddings-v2-base-es
- LLM: Phi-3
- TTS: Openvoice and Metavoice to generate the audios
- Midjourney: to generate some of the images. (The principals were done by artist Isabela Hern√°ndez)

# Coming soon
The poems embedding is also missing.
This audios and images will be uploaded to youtube and added as a columns to the embeddings and also have a separate website where one can explore,comment, rate and subscribe to listen to this stories in a customized way with users and states. I'm also doing an embeddings for all the poems.
I have without the audio for now, the poems and suggesting the most similar poems after the ones that you are reading. After that, the customization would be like adding their own voice or how they want the story to be like or how hard it is to read. All these stories are being made in an english speaking version which is not completetly great but is decent.

# Contribute
If anyone want to contribute please Push a PR, or send me an email mostly the tsv and [json](authorLinksSmaller.json)
containing the metadata file of [stories_metadata.tsv](tensor_generator/stories_metadata.tsv) inside tensor_generator 
needs more attention. Need to turn them into csv, json or parquet to be eassily monitored. Finetuning 
the translation to make them really available would be really great.

## Explanation
I wanted to be able to see the stories that I liked, which authors I had read and hearing them from Carl's voice to explore everything the classical literature that I love has!! so I did this for me and for anyone else who also wants to explore Classical Literature. Also, to eassily get to know new authors or stories similar to what they already like or know, which in my case, took some time to read the recommendation from the prologues or by reading wikipedia, so I hope this helps but keep exploring and reading wikipedia and the books directly nonetheless!
These are 3092 short stories all under 8 minutes long approximately. They are scraped and annotated by me, wikipedia and the 
help of some LLMs. I embedded these stories using one of the best open source models for Spanish classification and 
extraction with high enough input tokens so that the entire story would fit that I could find at that moment.
All stories are in spanish originally. I used full open source models and computers (including GPUS) that were all free 
as a self limitation (Thank you Colab). I used Pinecone as a VectorDB. The Author Links was created using the Wikipedia API and seeing 
which other authors were mentioned, some of the authors couldn't get scraped by a wikipedia page so there is still work 
to be done.
Thank you open source people, literature databases in spanish that are too old like amediavoz.com
 and free trials or amounts per month for making this possible!!
