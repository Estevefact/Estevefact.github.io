# Coem visualizer
This is part of the Coem project in which I'm trying to visualize all classical short stories into an embeddings map.
The english version is coming and the poem embeddings of almost 5000 poems are also comming.

Visualize it here [Coem](Estevelag.github.io.)

# Limits
the color are only for 50 categories at maximum

## Explanation
These are 3092 short stories all under 7 minutes approximately long an scraped and annotated by me, wikipedia and the 
help of some LLMs. I embded using one of the best open source models for Spanish classification and extraction with high
enough input tokens so that the entire story would fit. All stories are in spanish originally. I used full open source 
models and computers that were all free as a self limitation.

# Coming soon
I Generated a Carl Sagan Voice with an openvoice model and I'm generating an mp3 file for each story, this will be 
uploaded to youtube and spotify and also have a separate website where one can explore, comment, rate and hear this
stories. All these stories are also being translated and an english speakjing version is also on the works.

# Contribute
If anyone want to contribute please Push a PR, or send me an email mostly the excel file of coem_authors_enriched inside
tensor_generator needs more attention.
